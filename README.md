# Spotting High-Risk Alcohol Consuming Students
This project uses machine learning to predict students at high risk of alcohol consumption. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is implemented to classify and analyze high-risk students based on their academic and personal data.

**Dataset:** Student Alcohol Consumption dataset from Kaggle, containing student demographics, study habits, and alcohol consumption data.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection
- Implementation of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for classification
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and other metrics
